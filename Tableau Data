-- Two different datasets are placed here that were used to create several visuals on my Tableau Public account
-- Data from http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC and http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.KT both last updated 02/05/2016
-- Multiple spreadsheets: totalpopulation, gdptotal, energydata, and CO2Dataset
-- Want to look at data from 2000-2011
-- Joining multiple spreadsheet into one
select Emissions.Country_Name, Emissions.Year, Emissions.CO2_Per_Capita, EnergyData.Energy_use, TotalPopulation.Population_Total, gdptotal.current_GDP
from Emissions
join EnergyData on Emissions.Year = EnergyData.year and Emissions.Country_Name = EnergyData.Country
join TotalPopulation on Emissions.Year = TotalPopulation.Year and Emissions.Country_Name = TotalPopulation.Country
join gdptotal on Emissions.Year = gdptotal.year and Emissions.Country_Name = gdptotal.country

-- Viewing the differences between CO2 vs CO2 of previous year
select Year, CO2, lag(CO2) over (order by Year) as CO2_previous_year, (CO2 -  lag(CO2) over (order by Year)) as CO2_difference
from Emissions
group by Year

-- Viewing total global CO2 emissions by region
select Region, sum(CO2) as totalCO2
from Emissions
group by Region
